*South Georgia Coastline*

I have created a topojson, geojson, and simplified geojson from a shapefile describing the coastline of the South Georgia and Sandwich Islands. The simplified geojson was simplified by a factor of 70% using mapshaper (https://mapshaper.org/) online tool, which I also used to create the geojson and topojson files.
